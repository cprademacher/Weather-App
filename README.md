# Weather App

## Description

- Why did you build this project? I built this project to allow users to search a city and find out that
location's weather for the current day as well as the next five day forecast.

- I learned how to utilize third party APIs and pull in a variety of information that updates with
user input.


## Installation

I wrote the code from scratch and used the 5 day weather forecast api to fetch weather data, as well
as the dayjs api to bring in the current and future dates.  Then I used GitHub Pages to deploy the application to the web.

## Usage

Users just need to type in a city into the input text box and hit enter to see the weather and forecast
